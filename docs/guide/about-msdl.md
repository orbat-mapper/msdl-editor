# About MSDL

Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) is a standardized format for describing military scenarios and simulations.

## What is MSDL?

MSDL (Military Scenario Definition Language) is an XML-based language designed to represent military scenarios in a
standardized, interoperable format. It allows different simulation systems and tools to exchange scenario data
consistently.

## Key Features of MSDL

- **Standardized Format**: Based on XML schemas for consistent data representation
- **Interoperability**: Enables data exchange between different military simulation systems
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports units, deployments, equipment, and scenario metadata
- **Extensible**: Can be extended to support specific simulation requirements

## MSDL in Practice

MSDL files typically contain:

- **Force structures**: Military units and their hierarchical organization
- **Deployments**: Geographic positioning of forces
- **Equipment**: Detailed descriptions of military assets
- **Scenario metadata**: Information about the simulation scenario

## Related Projects

MSDL Editor is built on top of [msdllib](https://github.com/orbat-mapper/msdllib), a TypeScript library for working with
MSDL files. This library provides the core functionality for parsing, validating, and manipulating MSDL data.
