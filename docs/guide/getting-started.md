# Getting Started

Welcome to MSDL Editor, a tool for viewing and editing Military Scenario Definition Language (MSDL) files.

## What is MSDL Editor?

MSDL Editor is a web-based application that allows you to:

- Load and view MSDL files
- Edit military scenarios
- Export data in various formats
- Work entirely client-side (no data uploads to servers)

## Quick Start

1. **Open the application**: Visit [msdl-editor.pages.dev](https://msdl-editor.pages.dev)
2. **Load a file**: Click "Load File" to open an existing MSDL file
3. **Edit your scenario**: Use the interface to modify units, deployments, and other scenario elements
4. **Save your work**: Export your scenario when you're done editing

## Development

If you want to run MSDL Editor locally or contribute to development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orbat-mapper/msdl-editor.git
cd msdl-editor
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
